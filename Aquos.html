  <p>Sebastian the Jamaican red crab may have preached the virtues of living "Under the Sea" in Disney's "The Little Mermaid," but so far humans have failed to come round to the crustacean's way of thinking.</p>
  <p>Indeed, the future of human habitation, whether through choice or catastrophe, is often imagined (in popular culture at least) as being beyond Earth's orbit. Sub-aquatic living still seems, perversely it could be argued, very alien.</p>
  <p>Not so for Aquos. Aquos is a series of underwater eco-villages that house up to 20,000 people. Aquos is entirely self-sufficient with spiraling "oceanscrapers" reaching to the sea floor from mangrove-covered marinas on the surface of the world's oceans.</p>
  <p>As well as living space, Aquos houses schools, offices, hotels, sports fields and farms across 250 floors and reach a depth of up to 1,000 meters (3,280 feet). Seawater is desalinated for drinking, microalgae will recycle organic waste, and light is provided through bioluminescence.</p>
  <p>Those concerned about the unsettling effects of strong currents, storms, or even earthquakes--fear not! The towers' geometry and ballasting will counteract marine whirlpools and natural buoyancy, while the thickness of the outer shell will increase from the sea surface downwards, to compensate for the strain caused by the increase in pressure.</p>
