      <h1>Living With Water</h1>
      </header>
    <section>
        <p>Welcome to Earthâ€™s first underwater city and the future of urban living.  Aqua offers a variety of living options to suit your needs from single family homes to seascrapers and group living pods.</p>
        <h1>H2ome</h1>
        <p>The H2ome represents the world's first undersea residence - a structure that you can purchase today. You can choose your own sea-floor site, or we can set you up with a remarkable undersea location. Remember, the entire undersea structure is at surface pressure, so there is no diving or de-compression necessary to inhabit this wondrous luxury sea floor residence.</p>

        <h1>Seascraper</h1>
        <p>Seascraper is essentially a small village. The main house, the "whirlpool," acts as a village commons with individual dwelling units arranged around the perimeter.</p>

        <p>Have a group of family or friends that you want to live near?  Aquapod could be for you.  Offering private living quarters with some shared amenities allows for the future of co-habitation.</p>
